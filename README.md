# NASA Turbofan Predictive Maintenance with Deep Learning
In the aerospace industry, ensuring the safety of passengers and crew is of utmost importance. One of the key challenges faced by aircraft manufacturers and operators is predicting when an engine is likely to fail. In this project, we aim to address this challenge by using deep learning techniques to predict the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of turbofan engines.

The data used in this project is provided by NASA and represents the Turbofan Engine Degradation Simulation dataset. This dataset contains sensor readings from multiple sensors installed on a fleet of turbofan engines. Our task is to develop a model that can accurately predict the RUL of each engine, given its current state and the historical sensor readings.

# 1. Introduction
The goal of this project is to develop an effective model that can accurately predict when an aircraft engine is likely to fail. By doing so, aircraft manufacturers and operators can make informed decisions about maintenance schedules and avoid costly engine failures. In order to accomplish this, we will use the Turbofan Engine Degradation Simulation dataset provided by NASA and employ deep learning techniques to predict the RUL of each engine.

# 2. Dataset
The Turbofan Engine Degradation Simulation dataset contains sensor readings from 100 different turbofan engines, each of which have experienced different levels of degradation. The dataset contains four different subsets, each corresponding to a different operational setting. For each subset, the data contains the following information:

time (in cycles)
21 sensor readings
Remaining Useful Life (RUL)
The RUL is given in units of cycles, and represents the number of remaining operational cycles until the engine is likely to fail.
